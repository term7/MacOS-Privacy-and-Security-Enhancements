# 01 About Wifi-OFF

**MORE INFO**<br>
[https://term7.info/wifi-off/](https://term7.info/wifi-off/)

On Linux it is relativey easy to configure your Laptop to start with its Wi-Fi interface switched off. For example Ubuntu remebers the last state of your Wi-Fi, which means when you switch off your Wi-Fi it will reboot with your Wi-Fi switched off. 

This is not so easy on MacOS. Apple computers often restore the last known Wi-Fi state after a reboot, but this isn't guaranteed. If switched off, Wi-Fi may still turn back on automatically due to system services overriding the previous state. Thereâ€™s no setting to prevent this, so we created a tool to keep Wi-Fi off at startup.

Your Mac always will probe for known networks are broadcast at boot. MAC address randomization is only used when scanning, not when joining networks. Auto-join behavior makes Evil Twin attacks and Man-in-the-Middle attacks more viable.

This is why we have written a simple tool that:

- Prevents any Wi-Fi traffic or scanning during boot and login.
- Blocks auto-reconnection to known networks.
- Makes Wi-Fi available only in a user-controlled state after login.
- Helps minimize MAC address tracking and probe leaks, especially in sensitive environments.

# 02 Installation

Our [interactive script](script/install_WiFi-OFF.sh) installs sets up two scripts and two <em>LaunchDaemon</em>, that automatically switch off your Wi-Fi every time you reboot your computer.

**BE CAREFUL: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK AT THE CONTENT OF ANY SHELL SCRIPT YOU DOWNLOAD FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE BEFORE YOU EXECUTE IT! VERIFY ITS CONTENT FIRST TO MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE TO EXECUTE.**

Open the Terminal.app (found with Spotlight or in your Applications -> Utilities Folder).
In your Terminal, navigate to your Downloads Folder:
```
cd ~/Downloads
```

Download the script (Codeberg or Github Mirror):

```
curl -O https://codeberg.org/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/raw/branch/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/install_WiFi-OFF.sh
```
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/install_WiFi-OFF.sh
```

Give the respective file execute permissions:
```
chmod +x install_WiFi-OFF.sh
```

Execute the script:
```
./install_WiFi-OFF.sh
```

If you want to uninstall MacPorts from your system, please download and execute our [UNINSTALL SCRIPT](script/UNINSTALL_SpoofMAC.sh) (Codeberg or Github Mirror):

```
curl -O https://codeberg.org/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/raw/branch/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/UNINSTALL_WiFi-OFF.sh
```
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/UNINSTALL_WiFi-OFF.sh
```

Alternatively you can also download our non-interactive [speedy install script](script/SPEEDY-INSTALL_WiFi-OFF.sh) (Codeberg or Github Mirror):

```
curl -O https://codeberg.org/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/raw/branch/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/SPEEDY-INSTALL_WiFi-OFF.sh
```
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/term7/MacOS-Privacy-and-Security-Enhancements/main/05_WiFi-OFF/script/SPEEDY-INSTALL_WiFi-OFF.sh
