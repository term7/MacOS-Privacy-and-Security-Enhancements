# 01 - Install MacPorts

This installation script is targeted to users who wish to make informed decisions and who want to improve their privacy and security on a Mac. We want everybody to be able to able to do this installation, which is why this script is meant to be educative and a source of learning - especially for users who have never used the command line (Terminal.app) before.

## Why install MacPorts?

The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative that enables you to install and compile software on your Mac, that otherwise runs natively on Linux. Another popular packet manager that supposedly is easier to use than MacPorts is Homebrew. However we prefer MacPorts because it does not download binaries, but compiles them instead. Further it maintains its own library tree and is fully independent from the OS which makes it less likely to break after major MacOS software updates.
